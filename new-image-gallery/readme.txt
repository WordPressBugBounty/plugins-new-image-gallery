== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create an image gallery? =

Go to New Image Gallery > Add Image Gallery in your WordPress dashboard. Click the Add Images button to select photos from your media library. Configure your layout settings and save. Copy the shortcode shown at the top and paste it into any post or page.

= Can I add multiple galleries on the same page? =

Yes. Each gallery has a unique shortcode with its own ID. You can paste multiple shortcodes on a single page, and each gallery will display independently.

= What is the shortcode format? =

The shortcode format is `[IMG-Gal id=X]` where X is your gallery ID number. You'll find this shortcode at the top of each gallery's edit screen.

= Is this gallery mobile-friendly? =

Yes. The galleries use responsive design that adjusts automatically to phones, tablets, and desktop screens. Images resize and columns stack as needed for smaller viewports.

= Can I customize the lightbox appearance? =

The free version includes the LD Lightbox style. The Pro version adds 5 more lightbox styles with different designs and animations. You can choose the one that matches your site.

= How do I add images to an existing gallery? =

Edit your gallery from the New Image Gallery menu. Click the Add Images button to open the media uploader. Select additional images and save your gallery. The new images appear alongside existing ones.

= Does this work with page builders? =

Yes. Since galleries work through shortcodes, you can paste them into any page builder's text or shortcode element. This includes Elementor, Beaver Builder, Divi, and others.

= Can I display a gallery in sidebar widgets? =

Yes. Use the Text widget or Custom HTML widget in your sidebar. Paste your gallery shortcode there, and the gallery will appear in the sidebar area.

= What image formats are supported? =

The gallery supports all standard web image formats including JPG, PNG, GIF, and WebP. Use whatever format is already in your WordPress media library.

= How do I upgrade to the Pro version? =

Visit [AWPLife](https://awplife.com/wordpress-plugins/image-gallery-premium/) to purchase a license. After purchase, download the Pro plugin, deactivate the free version, and install the Pro version. Your existing galleries will continue to work.

= Can I add captions to images? =

Yes. When adding images, each image can have a title that displays on hover or below the image, depending on your settings.
